        <h1>Darsh Srivastava Profile</h1>
        <p>Darsh was the one who played fairly throughout the admin staff and was one of the most voted admins. His skills and dominance were very high. He was great to hear that he is an admin. Before, he worked as a comic creator for the group, but now officially he is an admin to the N95. He also crosses his limit but not very much.</p>
