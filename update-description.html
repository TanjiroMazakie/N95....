        <p class="large-text">Descriptions come from various data sources and can’t be edited. To update descriptions, you can contact the source of the information and ask them to correct it. Changing the source of the information usually causes the information in the knowledge panel to change as well.</p>
        <p>If you contacted the source but couldn’t get a description changed, you can submit feedback on the knowledge panel. Explain that you contacted the source and provide strong evidence for why the description is inaccurate.</p>
        <p>If the evidence is strong, we can remove the description but we can’t create a custom description. Our systems may attempt to add a description from other sources, but usually the knowledge panel goes without a description.</p>
