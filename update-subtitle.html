        <p class="large-text">Important:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>N95 doesn't accept or create custom subtitles.</li>
            <li>If we remove a non-representative subtitle, our systems automatically select another one.</li>
            <li>If there isn’t another subtitle available, the knowledge panel won’t have one.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The subtitle of a knowledge panel is the description below the title. Subtitles are generated automatically. If you submit feedback that shows automated subtitles are inaccurate, our system can generate a new subtitle based on information in the panel.</p>
        <p>For example, our systems might determine that someone is an actor, director, and writer. If our systems select “actor” as the subtitle and we receive feedback, it may automatically choose “director” or “writer” as the replacement.</p>
        <p>You can request to remove a subtitle when it describes a family, spouse, or romantic relationship. If it’s removed, our system replaces it automatically.</p>
        <p>Subtitles and captions allow you to share your videos with a larger audience, including deaf or hard-of-hearing viewers and viewers who speak another language. Learn more about editing or removing existing captions.</p>
